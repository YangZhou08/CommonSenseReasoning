Q: John heard a language that he could not understand. He thought that the door was shut, but he eventually realized that there was no door, and that the light source that was blinding his eyes was very familiar.  He was on his back looking at what?
Options: (a) sky (b) lamp (c) hallway (d) dard (e) closed room
A: The answer must be a place where there are people speaking, no door, and also there is a light source that is intensively strong. lamp is a light source, but not intensively strong, hallway is a place with doors, and closed room also has some doors. Sky is the only place that has no door and a very strong light source, sun, during the day. Also, John can be on his back looking at the sky and hearing people speaking. So the answer is sky (a).
